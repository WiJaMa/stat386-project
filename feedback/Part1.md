Hunter Croxall's feedback:
Part 1 Feedback: As a POLI sci minor I find this topic to be super interesting! It's awesome that you took on such a sizeable dataset for this project. I liked the step by step process of gathering data, and the exploratory analysis you completed to handle outliers. I only felt that the different heading didn't stand out super strongly from the text so perhaps putting lines between each section or making the header titles bigger could make each section more clear. Otherwise I think it is awesome!

you talk about merging tables but don't show any intermediary steps that show what the table looks like in between
```

jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:09 PM]

jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:10 PM]
you do a good job of talking through the stats and showing the results
```
```
jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:10 PM]
you don't treat the code the same way
```
```
jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:10 PM]
