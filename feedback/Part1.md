Hunter Croxall's feedback:
Part 1 Feedback: As a POLI sci minor I find this topic to be super interesting! It's awesome that you took on such a sizeable dataset for this project. I liked the step by step process of gathering data, and the exploratory analysis you completed to handle outliers. I only felt that the different heading didn't stand out super strongly from the text so perhaps putting lines between each section or making the header titles bigger could make each section more clear. Otherwise I think it is awesome!

idk how easy it is for you to add css
```
At this point, he hammered the point home by linking to [this site](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/). The rest of his feedback was as follows:

also the image is too big
```
```
jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:07 PM]
and by "the image" I mean the first one in the first one
```
```
jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:07 PM]
actually the second but you know what I mean
```
```
jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:08 PM]
you talk about merging tables but don't show any intermediary steps that show what the table looks like in between
```
```
jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:08 PM]
idk if that matters but
```
```
jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:09 PM]
it's nice to see the output of code you talk about
```
```
jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:09 PM]
it's like talking about plots, except it's code
```
```
jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:10 PM]
ok idk what I meant by that sentence
```
```
jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:10 PM]
the longer version:
```
```
jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:10 PM]
you do a good job of talking through the stats and showing the results
```
```
jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:10 PM]
you don't treat the code the same way
```
```
jakey martydart, [12/17/2023 11:10 PM]
would be nice if you did
```

Sam Lee's feedback:
Hey William, I looked through your blog and overall it looks pretty good! I appreciated your introduction. I thought it was concise enough to get the point. I thought you did a good job of explaining the World Bank API and I liked how you linked all the indicators that you used. The only thing that I would suggest is add a navigational component to the markdown file that allows you to navigate to each subsection of page.

As for your EDA, I think it looks great. Although I think most stats-savvy readers may be able to pick up what's going on here, I think some additional explanation could be useful. For example, though you show that a log transformation makes the data more Normal, why is that important? Additionally there is a small typo, "Whie there is nothing we can do about this at this point": "Whie" should be "While"


I went through my post and fixed all the typos that people brought up. I changed the second-level headings to third-level headings to make them stand out more. from the top-level headings. Once I fixed the problem with my theme, my brother's feedback about the image and the css was automatically resolved. I couldn't figure out what intermediary steps my brother was missing in the merge so I left that part as is. I also felt that adding code results would detract from the actual steps being taken so I didn't add that. I couldn't find a way to add a navigational component to my markdown file, so I didn't do anything with that feedback. I added a brief sentence to explain why normality was good.
