Hunter Croxall's feedback:
Part 1 Feedback: As a POLI sci minor I find this topic to be super interesting! It's awesome that you took on such a sizeable dataset for this project. I liked the step by step process of gathering data, and the exploratory analysis you completed to handle outliers. I only felt that the different heading didn't stand out super strongly from the text so perhaps putting lines between each section or making the header titles bigger could make each section more clear. Otherwise I think it is awesome!
