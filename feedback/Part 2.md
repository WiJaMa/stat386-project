Hunter Croxall's feedback:
That was a very interesting read! I liked the depth of analysis and the statistical reasoning you used throughout. I did feel that it was a bit lengthy but I don't know it that was a bad thing. I also felt liked the headings and subheadings seemed similar in size which created just a small bit of confusion. Great work!

part 2 you do that so I'm just going to say it's a consequence of that

This was in reference to his feedback for Part 1 that mentioned that I don't really do a good job of showing the results of my code.

The default image for the site header is a random image from Unsplash. The default image for the blog post is from Unsplash by Mohamed Elsayed. Students in Stat 386 using this theme should replace both images with their own.

This was in reference to the default text on the bottom of the website, which I had not changed at the time.
