Hunter Croxall's feedback:
That was a very interesting read! I liked the depth of analysis and the statistical reasoning you used throughout. I did feel that it was a bit lengthy but I don't know it that was a bad thing. I also felt liked the headings and subheadings seemed similar in size which created just a small bit of confusion. Great work!
